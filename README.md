# Datathon 2024 🥭🤖🥭🤖🥭

Welcome to our GitHub repository featuring our solution to the Datathon FME 2024 Mango Challenge.
We are a team of three data scientist and one computer scientist.

The Mango Challenge demanded to make an specialization of a tagging model to identify clothing characteristics. We have used the pre-trained model EfficientNet-B2 with a modified last layer and backpropagation . Also they demanded a prototype of an app for their designers to tag de products and we have delivered using the popular PyQt6 framework.
