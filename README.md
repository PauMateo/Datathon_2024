## Overview  
The lifecycle of a fashion product involves multiple stages: from inspiration and design to prototyping and cataloging. Logging attributes like silhouette type, sleeve length, and more is a manual and time-consuming process. This challenge addresses this bottleneck by predicting attributes from images and metadata, automating the process for efficiency and accuracy.

Our solution uses **Transfer Learning** with the **EfficientNetB2** architecture, fine-tuned for this task, combined with a **PyQT-based GUI** to provide an intuitive and functional interface.

## Solution Approach  

1. **Model Training**  
   - A pre-trained **EfficientNetB2** convolutional neural network (CNN) was fine-tuned using PyTorch to extract meaningful features from product images.  
   - Custom training loops ensured high performance and adaptability to the challenge's specific requirements.  

2. **Prediction**  
   - Each product in the test set is processed to predict attribute values across 11 possible types.  
   - Items with non-applicable attributes are assigned the value `"INVALID"`.  

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
   - Developed using **PyQT**, the GUI allows users to:  
     - Load product images  
     - Input the clothe type  
     - View predicted attribute values in real time
   - The interface ensures usability for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Features  

- **High Accuracy**: Fine-tuning EfficientNetB2 ensures precise attribute prediction.  
- **Intuitive GUI**: A user-friendly PyQT-based interface for visualization and interaction.  
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable for future datasets and attribute types.  
- **Error Handling**: Automatically handles non-applicable attributes with the `"INVALID"` designation.

## Tech Stack  

- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch  
- **Model Architecture**: EfficientNetB2 (Transfer Learning)  
- **GUI Framework**: PyQT  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: PyQT Widgets
